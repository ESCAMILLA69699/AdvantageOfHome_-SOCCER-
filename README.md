# AdvantageOfHome_SOCCER
The advantage of team that play at their home stadium using Kaggle for the data. Precisely, I used the year, 2010, for the teams of my liking. 


Data came from Kaggle: Home Advantage in Soccer and Basketball
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgilermo/home-advantage-in-soccer-and-basketball/data?select=SoccerLEagues.csv
SoccerLEagues.csv
The csv included stats about teams and their home advantage in soccer.
Columns from csv: Sport, Country, League, Year, Season, Team, Games, HomeWins, HomeDraws, HomeLosses, HomeRatio, AwayWins, AwayDraws, AwayLosses, AwayGoalDiff 
I created a biased dataframe, which I extracted top 5 best teams / atmosphere from 2010.
Column I extracted for my use: Year, Teams, Games, HomeWins, HomeDraws, HomeLosses, AwayWins, AwayDraws, and AwayLosses
Teams from my choosing: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester United.
The main purpose was to demonstrate the advantage in soccer to play at home using the top five team from 2010 (IMO).
Using Real Madrid and Barcelona from La Liga and the rest from the English Premier League
